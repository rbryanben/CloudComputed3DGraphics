- Optimisations:
  - Better method to determine the grids a triangle passes through
  - If the y co-ordinate when texturing is out of the grids y bounds then dont compute anything
  - If the x co-ordinate is out of the grids bounds then compute anything 
  - Store the frame buffer as a vector and not a grid. Iterating through the entire grid is costly
- Tasks:
  - Migrate primary tasks to the GPU
  - Multiple light sources
  - Project light color to object 
  - Better scene 
  - Active Ray Tracing:
    - Subtasks here
  - Migrate heavy workloads to the GPU
- Notes:
  - subGridRasterMax - This is the maximum triangles a single subgrid can raster. It has a direct influence on detail.

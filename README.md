# Dune Engine
<img src="./logo.png" height="300px">
The idea behind Dune is to build a three-dimensional rendering engine capable of both client and server side rendering. This will work by moving some
processes of the 3D rendering pipeline to a remote server, thereby relieving the client of some heavy workload. By doing so, we should allow a client 
to render three-dimensional scenes that they were not capable of rendering before.
